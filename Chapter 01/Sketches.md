# Design Sketches after IA

- Once you've got the main content mapped out, start making some *basic design*
*sketches*

- The sketches should be *black & white*, *drawn on paper* and cover only the
layout of the site/page

- This way, the customer's focus will be completely on the basic layout design

- Once a layout is decided, make a few copies of the sketch with different
colors

- Then, you can come up with the content and finally create a *prototype*
