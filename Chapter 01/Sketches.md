# Design Sketches after IA

- Once you've got the main content mapped out, start making some *basic design*
*sketches*

- The sketches should be *black & white*, *drawn on paper*

- This way, the customer's focus will be completely on the basic layout design

- Your designs should show some basic layouts in various configurations

- Once the layout is decided, make a few copies of the sketch with different
colors

- Once the basic color palate is finalized, you can come up with the content
and create a prototype
