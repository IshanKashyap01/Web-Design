# Information Architecture

- It is a process by which your website's content is broken into chunks and
organized in a hierarchical manner

- It is typically represented by the *reverse branching-bush* diagram

- Although *any diagram* that can clearly show the *relation and hierarchy* of
your website's *sections and subsections* can be used

- It usually look like a *hierarchical diagram of your navigation layout*

## Process to Develop an IA

- Start by asking what content is needed for the site

- Your IA will always begin with the home or main page at the top of the
hierarchy

- Top level navigation usually links to the sections one tier below the home
page in IA
