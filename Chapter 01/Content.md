# Writing Content for the Web

- Users like to scan the text for keywords and concepts to get an idea about
the contents of a page

- Additionally, they don't spend much time on individual pages

- Therefore, the text of a webpage must be scannable

- Short paragraphs, headings, bullet points, and emphasis (bold, italics, etc.)
help users scan the page more easily
