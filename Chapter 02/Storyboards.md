# Storyboards

- One of the most important things in pre-production is the *storyboard*
(concept art)

- Storyboards are hand-drawn concept arts used to visualize your design as a
complete entity

- They are used to visualize your design in its entirety by giving you a chance
to see how:

  - Colors interact with each another

  - Interface elements play-off one another

  - Navigational system looks

  - Your visual metaphor plays out

  - Whether the content is represented in the best way possible

- They are the next level of *brainstorming* after coming up with a theme:

  - deciding visual metaphor and design element ideas
