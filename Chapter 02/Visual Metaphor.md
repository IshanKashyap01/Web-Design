# Visual Metaphor and Theme

- The **theme** of a site refers to its *purpose and/or content*

- Once you know what content you'll be working with, it's time to work on a
**visual metaphor**

- A *visual metaphor* takes advantage of *familiar visual elements* (like images,
interfaces, icons, color, etc.) to *reinforces the site's theme*

- Developing a visual metaphor is all about *brainstorming about your client's*
*content, audience, and what visual elements they'd like to see*

## Steps to Develop a Visual Metaphor

### 1. List down your ideas

- List down everything that comes to mind and don't discredit any ideas or
concepts you come up with

- The list can include design ideas, content consideration, site sections, even
color and imagery

### 2. Choose some color palettes

- Pick colors that work well with the content and support the theme of the site

- Use services like [color adobe](https://color.adobe.com)

### 3. Make Layout Decisions

- Make layout decisions based on the content; the more columns you have, the
more space you have to fill

- Remember, whitespaces are important, so don't fill out every available pixel

- Layout affects the overall visual metaphor as it dictates what can or can't
appear on a page

### 4. Use visual elements to reinforce the theme

- Refer to your list of ideas to come up with display elements that emphasize
your site's main themes

- Use *imagery, iconography, and text* to make the site look like the content
