# How to Create a Storyboard

## Find some Paper and make a Grid

- Grab a piece of paper and either sketch or fold it to create a grid on it

- Grids allow you to line up elements and makes sense to the users' eyes

- You can use a printed blank browser to see how the site would look in a
chrome window

## Sketch out Your Design

- Create a layout and sketch logos, images, and anything else that comes to
mind

- All of the site's text can be replaced with a box with "text appears here" on
it

- The point of the storyboard is to play with and finalize the layout by
focusing on the major elements

- However, do not care about slogans or text links; just give your client a
*basic idea* of their site

## Add Color and Finalize your Storyboard

- It's important to add colors to your storyboard as they change everything

- You should use color pencils or crayons to add colors

- Your colors may not be accurate but should be close enough to see how they
play off one another

- Once you're finished with colors, fill in any missing details and your
storyboard is ready to show to the client
